# 🚀 Mainframe CI/CD Modernization Playbook

This playbook provides a comprehensive, step-by-step technical guide for modernizing mainframe applications (IBM z/OS, Unisys ClearPath, Bull GCOS, NEC ACOS) using Azure AI Foundry integrated with GitHub and Azure DevOps. It follows a hybrid approach that preserves existing investments while enabling modern DevOps practices and AI capabilities.

## 📋 Overview

This technical implementation guide serves as a complete resource for IT professionals undertaking mainframe modernization initiatives. Azure AI Foundry functions as the central intelligence layer in the modernization ecosystem, providing:

- 🔍 Deep analysis of complex COBOL, PL/I, Assembler, and Natural code bases
- 🧠 Knowledge extraction from legacy mainframe systems
- 🤖 Intelligent decision-making throughout the modernization process
- 📊 Predictive insights for risk assessment and optimization
- ⚙️ Automation of routine tasks to accelerate development and deployment

The playbook offers detailed implementation guidance for both GitHub and Azure DevOps integration paths, allowing teams to select the platform that best suits their requirements.
