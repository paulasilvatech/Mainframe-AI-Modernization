# Azure AI Foundry Mainframe Modernization Playbook for IBM z/OS

This playbook provides a comprehensive, step-by-step technical guide for modernizing IBM z/OS mainframe applications using Azure AI Foundry integrated with GitHub and Azure DevOps. It follows a hybrid approach that preserves existing investments while enabling modern DevOps practices and AI capabilities.

## Overview

This technical implementation guide serves as a complete resource for IT professionals undertaking mainframe modernization initiatives. Azure AI Foundry functions as the central intelligence layer in the modernization ecosystem, providing:

- Deep analysis of complex COBOL, PL/I, and Assembler code bases
- Knowledge extraction from legacy IBM z/OS systems
- Intelligent decision-making throughout the modernization process
- Predictive insights for risk assessment and optimization
- Automation of routine tasks to accelerate development and deployment

The playbook offers detailed implementation guidance for both GitHub and Azure DevOps integration paths, allowing teams to select the platform that best suits their requirements.

## Who is this playbook for?

- Mainframe developers and administrators
- DevOps engineers and practitioners
- Cloud architects and infrastructure teams
- IT implementation teams
- Technical project managers

## How to use this playbook

This technical playbook is organized as a sequential implementation guide. Each chapter provides detailed steps with:

- Clear technical objectives
- Implementation prerequisites 
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Detailed code examples and configuration settings
- Architecture and workflow diagrams
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- Validation steps to verify successful implementation
- "Next Steps" guidance to progress through the implementation
