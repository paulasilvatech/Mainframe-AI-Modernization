# Introduction to Azure AI Foundry for IBM z/OS Mainframe

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to Azure AI Foundry for IBM z/OS mainframe modernization. It covers the technical foundation, architecture components, integration patterns, and implementation roadmap.

## Overview

Azure AI Foundry is a specialized framework for modernizing IBM z/OS mainframe applications using Azure's AI capabilities. It provides an intelligence layer that integrates with existing mainframe environments to enable modernization through analysis, transformation, and optimization.

### Key Capabilities

- **Deep Mainframe Code Analysis**: Analyzes COBOL, PL/I, JCL, and Assembler code to extract business rules and application logic
- **Intelligent Modernization Planning**: Uses AI to identify optimal modernization paths and risk factors
- **Hybrid Operations Optimization**: Provides operational intelligence for managing hybrid mainframe/cloud environments
- **DevOps Integration**: Enables modern CI/CD practices for mainframe applications through GitHub and Azure DevOps

## Technical Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Risk Reduction | AI-powered analysis identifies dependencies and potential issues before migration |
| Accelerated Modernization | Automated code analysis and transformation reduces manual effort |
| Knowledge Preservation | Extracts and documents business rules and logic from legacy applications |
| Operational Efficiency | Optimizes hybrid operations through predictive analytics and monitoring |
| DevOps Integration | Enables modern development practices for mainframe code |

## Who Should Use This Framework

Azure AI Foundry for IBM z/OS is designed for:

- **Enterprise Architects** planning mainframe modernization initiatives
- **Mainframe Developers** looking to adopt modern development practices
- **DevOps Engineers** implementing CI/CD for mainframe applications
- **IT Operations Teams** managing hybrid mainframe/cloud environments
- **Business Stakeholders** seeking to preserve business logic during modernization
