## 📊 Analyzing Results

### 📑 Key Analysis Reports

The code analysis generates several reports:

1. **📋 Executive Summary**: High-level overview of the codebase
2. **📝 Business Rules Catalog**: Extracted business rules and logic
3. **🗃️ Data Dictionary**: Compilation of data structures and relationships
4. **📊 Quality Metrics Dashboard**: Code quality and complexity metrics
5. **🔗 Dependency Network**: Visualization of component relationships
6. **🔍 Modernization Recommendations**: Suggested approaches for transformation

### 📝 Business Rules Extraction

The business rules extraction capability identifies and documents business logic:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "BR-ACCT-001",
  "name": "Account Interest Calculation",
  "description": "Calculates monthly interest for savings accounts",
  "type": "Calculation",
  "complexity": "Medium",
  "source_locations": [
    {
      "program": "ACCTPROC.cbl",
      "start_line": 245,
      "end_line": 278
    }
  ],
  "variables": [
    {"name": "BALANCE", "type": "PIC 9(9)V99"},
    {"name": "INTEREST-RATE", "type": "PIC 9V999"},
    {"name": "ACCRUED-INTEREST", "type": "PIC 9(7)V99"}
  ],
  "logic": "IF ACCOUNT-TYPE = 'SAVINGS' AND BALANCE > 0\n  COMPUTE ACCRUED-INTEREST = (BALANCE * INTEREST-RATE) / 12\nEND-IF",
  "notes": "Interest calculated monthly on positive balances for savings accounts only"
}
```

### 📊 Quality Metrics

Code quality metrics help identify areas for improvement:

```
Program: CUSTMGMT.cbl
- Complexity: 87 (High)
- Maintainability Index: 42 (Low)
- Lines of Code: 2,453
- Comment Density: 8%
- Dead Code: 15%
- Duplicated Code: 22%
- Error Handling Coverage: 63%
```

### 🔗 Dependency Visualization

Dependency visualization helps understand component relationships:

```
CUSTMGMT.cbl
├── Calls: ACCTPROC.cbl, VALADDR.cbl, PRNTDOC.cbl
├── Uses Data: CUSTOMER.cpy, ACCOUNT.cpy
├── Reads: CUSTMAST.vsam, ACCTMAST.vsam
└── Writes: CUSTREPT.output

Executed By: CUSTJOB.jcl (STEP010)
```

## 💡 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing a Customer Management System

This example demonstrates analyzing a customer management COBOL program:

1. **🚀 Run Targeted Analysis**:

   ```bash
   az ai-foundry code-analysis run \
     --source ./mainframe-source/cobol/CUSTMGMT.cbl \
     --include-copybooks ./mainframe-source/copybooks \
     --focus business-rules,data-structures \
     --output ./analysis-results/custmgmt
   ```

2. **📝 Review Extracted Business Rules**:

   ```
   Business Rule: BR-CUST-001 (Customer Eligibility Verification)
   Location: CUSTMGMT.cbl (Lines 320-345)
   Summary: Determines customer eligibility for premium services based on
            account age, balance, and transaction history.
   Logic:
     IF ACCOUNT-AGE > 2 AND
        AVERAGE-BALANCE > 25000 AND
        TRANSACTION-COUNT > 5
        SET PREMIUM-ELIGIBLE TO TRUE
     ELSE
        SET PREMIUM-ELIGIBLE TO FALSE
   ```

3. **🗃️ Review Data Structures**:

   ```
   Data Structure: CUSTOMER-RECORD
   Defined in: CUSTOMER.cpy
   Used in: CUSTMGMT.cbl, ACCTPROC.cbl, CUSTINQ.cbl
   Fields:
     - CUST-ID          PIC X(10)
     - CUST-NAME        PIC X(30)
     - CUST-ADDRESS     PIC X(50)
     - CUST-PHONE       PIC X(15)
     - CUST-TYPE        PIC X(1)
     - CUST-STATUS      PIC X(1)
     - CUST-BALANCE     PIC 9(9)V99
     - CUST-OPEN-DATE   PIC 9(8)
   ```

### Example 2: Analyzing a Financial Transaction Processing System

This example demonstrates analyzing a more complex transaction processing system:

1. **🚀 Run Comprehensive Analysis**:

   ```bash
   az ai-foundry code-analysis run \
     --source ./mainframe-source/cobol/TRANSACT.cbl \
     --include-dependencies \
     --dependency-depth 2 \
     --focus all \
     --output ./analysis-results/transaction-system
   ```

2. **🔗 Review Dependency Map**:

   The analysis generates a visual dependency map showing relationships between components:

   ```
   TRANSACT.cbl (Transaction Processing)
   ├── Calls: ACCTVAL.cbl (Account Validation)
   │   ├── Calls: CUSTVAL.cbl (Customer Validation)
   │   └── Uses: ACCOUNT.cpy, VALIDATION.cpy
   ├── Calls: TRANLOG.cbl (Transaction Logging)
   │   ├── Writes: TRANLOG.vsam
   │   └── Uses: LOGDATA.cpy
   ├── Calls: BALUPDT.cbl (Balance Update)
   │   ├── Reads/Writes: ACCTMAST.vsam
   │   └── Uses: ACCOUNT.cpy
   └── Uses: TRANTYPE.cpy, ACCOUNT.cpy, ERRORS.cpy
   
   Executed By: TRANJOB.jcl (STEP020)
   ```

3. **📊 Review Quality Assessment**:

   ```
   Component: TRANSACT.cbl
   
   Critical Issues:
   - High Cyclomatic Complexity (142) in PROCESS-TRANSACTION paragraph
   - Duplicated code in error handling routines
   - Inadequate input validation for transaction amounts
   
   Modernization Recommendations:
   - Refactor PROCESS-TRANSACTION into smaller, focused routines
   - Implement centralized error handling
   - Enhance input validation for all transaction types
   - Consider extracting fee calculation logic as separate component
   ```

## 🔗 Integration with Dependency Mapping

Combine code analysis with dependency mapping for comprehensive insights:

```bash
# First run code analysis
az ai-foundry code-analysis run --source-dir ./mainframe-source --output-dir ./analysis-results

# Then run dependency mapping on the same codebase
python ../dependency-mapping/map_dependencies.py --source-dir ./mainframe-source --output ./analysis-results/dependency-map.json

# Generate integrated report
az ai-foundry generate-report --code-analysis ./analysis-results --dependency-map ./analysis-results/dependency-map.json --output ./final-report
```

The integrated analysis provides a comprehensive view of the application, combining business logic insights with structural dependencies.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| 🚫 Parsing errors in COBOL code | Verify that the code follows standard COBOL syntax or specify compiler dialect with `--dialect` option |
| 🔍 Missing copybook references | Ensure all copybooks are available and specify include directories with `--include-copybooks` |
| 📝 Incomplete business rule extraction | Adjust sensitivity with `--rule-sensitivity` parameter or annotate complex business rules in code comments |
| ⚠️ High resource usage during analysis | Analyze code in smaller batches or adjust `--memory-optimization` setting |
| ⌛ Dependency mapping timeout | Increase timeout with `--timeout` option or reduce scope with `--dependency-depth` |

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **🔍 Start with Focused Analysis**: Begin by analyzing core business-critical programs
2. **👥 Validate Extracted Rules**: Have domain experts review extracted business rules
3. **📊 Prioritize Based on Metrics**: Use quality metrics to prioritize modernization efforts
4. **📝 Document Insights**: Maintain documentation of insights gained from analysis
5. **🔄 Regular Analysis**: Run analysis regularly to track modernization progress
6. **🧪 Combine with Testing**: Use extracted business rules to generate test cases
