# Team Organization

This document outlines the recommended team organization and structure for implementing IBM z/OS mainframe modernization using Azure AI Foundry.

## Organizational Principles

Effective mainframe modernization requires a carefully designed team structure that balances mainframe expertise with cloud and modern development skills. The team organization should follow these principles:

1. **Cross-functional teams** - Combine mainframe and cloud skills in integrated teams
2. **Product-oriented structure** - Organize around business capabilities, not technologies
3. **DevOps culture** - Embed DevOps practices across all teams
4. **Skills transformation** - Continuously develop team capabilities
5. **Clear ownership** - Establish clear responsibilities and accountabilities

## Team Structure Overview
