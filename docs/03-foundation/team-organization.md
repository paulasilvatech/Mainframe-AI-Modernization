# ðŸ‘¥ Team Organization

This document outlines the recommended team organization and structure for implementing IBM z/OS mainframe modernization using Azure AI Foundry.

## Organizational Principles

Effective mainframe modernization requires a carefully designed team structure that balances mainframe expertise with cloud and modern development skills. The team organization should follow these principles:

1. **Cross-functional teams** - Combine mainframe and cloud skills in integrated teams
2. **Product-oriented structure** - Organize around business capabilities, not technologies
3. **DevOps culture** - Embed DevOps practices across all teams
4. **Skills transformation** - Continuously develop team capabilities
5. **Clear ownership** - Establish clear responsibilities and accountabilities

## Team Structure Overview

## Skills Transformation

Mainframe modernization requires ongoing skills development. The recommended approach includes:

### Skills Assessment

Conduct a skills assessment to identify gaps in the following areas:

1. **Technical Skills** - Mainframe technologies, cloud platforms, modern development
2. **Process Skills** - Agile methodologies, DevOps practices, automation
3. **Domain Knowledge** - Business processes, industry regulations, data models
4. **Soft Skills** - Collaboration, change management, problem-solving

### Learning Paths

Establish learning paths for different roles:

| Role | Learning Path |
|------|--------------|
| Mainframe Developer | Cloud fundamentals â†’ Modern development practices â†’ Specific cloud technologies |
| Cloud Developer | Mainframe concepts â†’ Legacy code understanding â†’ Integration patterns |
| Operations | Hybrid operations â†’ Cloud monitoring â†’ SRE practices |

### Training Approaches

Implement a multi-faceted training approach:
