# Foundation Setup

This chapter provides the essential foundation components for your IBM z/OS mainframe modernization journey using Azure AI Foundry with GitHub and Azure DevOps integration.

## Overview

Before implementing technical components, a solid foundation must be established. This includes defining your modernization strategy, establishing governance frameworks, and preparing your environment for the transformation journey. The foundation phase sets the guardrails for your modernization initiative and helps ensure consistent implementation across teams.

## Key Components

This chapter covers the following foundational components:

- [Modernization Strategy](modernization-strategy.md) - Comprehensive approaches for mainframe modernization (rehost, refactor, rearchitect, replace, and hybrid)
- Governance Framework (Coming Soon) - Establishing controls, processes, and decision structures for modernization
- Reference Architecture (Coming Soon) - Technical architecture patterns for mainframe modernization
- Team Organization (Coming Soon) - Structuring teams and roles for modernization success

## Objectives

- Establish a clear modernization strategy aligned with business goals
- Define governance processes for the modernization initiative
- Create a reference architecture for implementation teams to follow
- Organize teams effectively for modernization activities
- Enable consistent decision-making throughout the modernization journey

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the foundation components:

- Complete the [Discovery and Assessment](../02-discovery/README.md) phase
- Obtain business stakeholder alignment on modernization goals
- Identify key team members for modernization leadership
- Gather existing architectural documentation for mainframe systems
- Establish initial budget and timeline expectations

## Implementation Steps

1. Review the [Modernization Strategy Guide](modernization-strategy.md) and select appropriate approaches for your applications
2. Develop a phased implementation roadmap based on application dependencies
3. Establish your governance framework with clear decision-making structures
4. Define your reference architecture patterns for implementation
5. Organize your teams according to the modernization approach selected

## Next Steps

After establishing your modernization foundation:

1. Set up your [Development Environment](../04-development-environment/README.md)
2. Implement [AI-Powered Code Analysis](../05-code-analysis/README.md) 
3. Select and configure your integration approach ([GitHub](../06-github-integration/README.md) or [Azure DevOps](../07-azure-devops-integration/README.md))
4. Begin your [AI-Powered Transformation](../08-ai-transformation/README.md) journey
