## Governance Overview

The governance framework establishes the structure, processes, and controls needed to manage the multi-platform mainframe modernization journey efficiently. It defines the decision-making processes, roles and responsibilities, risk management approaches, and compliance considerations specific to Azure AI Foundry implementation across different mainframe environments.

## Governance Structure

### Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides overall technical governance:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Enterprise Architect | Ensures architectural standards and alignment with enterprise strategy |
| Platform Technical Leads | Represent platform-specific technical considerations (IBM z/OS, Unisys ClearPath, Bull GCOS, NEC ACOS) |
| Cloud Platform Architect | Ensures cloud platform compatibility and integration |
| DevOps Lead | Oversees CI/CD and automation processes |
| Security Lead | Ensures security and compliance requirements are met |
| Business Domain Expert | Represents business priorities and requirements |

The TSC meets bi-weekly to:
- Review modernization progress against technical milestones across all platforms
- Address technical blocking issues and platform-specific risks
- Approve architectural decisions and changes with cross-platform considerations
- Resolve cross-team dependencies and conflicts
- Coordinate integration approaches between platforms

### Technical Working Groups

Specialized working groups focus on specific aspects of the modernization:

1. **Architecture Working Group**
   - Platform architecture decisions for each mainframe environment
   - Cross-platform integration patterns and standards
   - Technical debt management
   - Performance and scalability standards
   - Platform-specific considerations and adaptations

2. **DevOps Working Group**
   - Multi-platform CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Automation standards and practices for each mainframe platform
   - Environment management
   - Platform-specific deployment strategies
   - Cross-platform build and release orchestration

3. **Security Working Group**
   - Security architecture and controls for each platform
   - Platform-specific compliance validation
   - Cross-platform access management
   - Data protection standards across environments
   - Security integration between legacy and modern systems

4. **AI and Analytics Working Group**
   - AI implementation standards for diverse mainframe codebases
   - Analytics framework and practices
   - Platform-specific knowledge extraction methodologies
   - ML model management for different language and platform contexts
   - Cross-platform data correlation and analysis

## Decision-Making Framework

The governance framework implements a structured decision-making process:

```mermaid

    DR["Decision\nRequest"] --> IA["Impact\nAnalysis"]
    IA --> DA["Decision\nApproval"]
    DR --> OE["Options\nEvaluation"]
    OE --> IP["Implementation\nPlanning"]
    IP --> VR["Validation\n& Review"]
    DA --> VR
```

### Decision Levels

Decisions are categorized into three levels:

| Decision Level | Description | Approval Authority | Examples |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Strategic | Affects overall modernization approach | TSC | Platform modernization prioritization, cross-platform integration approach |
| Tactical | Affects specific implementation areas | Working Group + TSC review | Platform-specific tool selection, integration patterns |
| Operational | Day-to-day implementation decisions | Implementation Team | Specific implementation techniques for each platform |

### Platform-Specific Considerations

Each platform requires specific governance considerations:

| Platform | Governance Considerations |
|----------|--------------------------|
| IBM z/OS | IBM software licensing, RACF security integration, CICS/IMS transaction governance |
| Unisys ClearPath | ClearPath Forward licensing, DMSII data governance, MCP/OS 2200 security integration |
| Bull GCOS | GCOS licensing, TPR governance, Bull security integration |
| NEC ACOS | ACOS-4 licensing, AIM data governance, ACOS security frameworks |

### Decision Documentation

All significant decisions are documented using the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format:

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Approved | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Technical context and problem statement]

## Platform Scope
[IBM z/OS | Unisys ClearPath | Bull GCOS | NEC ACOS | Cross-Platform]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences of this decision]

## Alternatives Considered

## Risk Management Framework

The governance framework includes a comprehensive risk management process:

### Risk Categories

| Risk Category | Description | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Technical | Risks related to technology implementation | Integration failures, performance issues, platform compatibility |
| Process | Risks related to process changes | Deployment disruptions, testing inadequacies |
| People | Risks related to skills and organization | Platform-specific knowledge gaps, resistance to change |
| Security | Risks related to security and compliance | Platform-specific security integration, compliance gaps |
| Business | Risks related to business impact | Service disruptions, functionality gaps |
| Cross-Platform | Risks related to interactions between platforms | Integration failures, data synchronization issues |

### Platform-Specific Risk Factors

Each mainframe platform introduces specific risk factors:

| Platform | Key Risk Factors |
|----------|-----------------|
| IBM z/OS | COBOL/PL1 transformation accuracy, CICS/IMS compatibility, DB2 data migration |
| Unisys ClearPath | COBOL/Algol translation, DMSII to relational mapping, COMS transaction integrity |
| Bull GCOS | GCOS COBOL dialect translation, IDS/II data migration, TP8 compatibility |
| NEC ACOS | ACOS COBOL compatibility, AIM database migration, ACOS transaction processing |

### Risk Assessment Process

1. **Risk Identification**
   - Regular risk assessment workshops for each platform
   - Automated risk detection through AI Foundry
   - Platform-specific risk registry maintenance
   - Cross-platform risk analysis

2. **Risk Analysis**
   - Impact and probability assessment
   - Platform-specific risk scoring and prioritization
   - Dependency analysis across platforms
