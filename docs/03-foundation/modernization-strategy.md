# ðŸŽ¯ Modernization Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for mainframe modernization across multiple platforms (IBM z/OS, Unisys ClearPath, Bull GCOS, and NEC ACOS) using Azure AI Foundry.

## Overview

Mainframe modernization requires a carefully planned strategy that balances technical feasibility, business value, and risk mitigation. Azure AI Foundry provides AI-powered capabilities to accelerate and de-risk your modernization journey. This guide presents different modernization strategies and helps you select the approach that best fits your organization's needs.

## Modernization Approaches

### 1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)

**Description**: Move mainframe applications to the cloud with minimal code changes, using emulation technologies.

**Characteristics**:
