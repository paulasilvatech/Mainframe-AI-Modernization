   - Used AI for optimizing batch processing windows
   - Deployed intelligent monitoring for hybrid operations

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. Mainframe Source Control Configuration

The implementation started with proper source control configuration:

**.gitattributes**:
```
# COBOL source files
*.cbl text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=IBM-1047 zos-working-tree-encoding=utf-8
*.cob text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=IBM-1047 zos-working-tree-encoding=utf-8
*.cpy text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=IBM-1047 zos-working-tree-encoding=utf-8

# JCL procedures
*.jcl text eol=lf working-tree-encoding=IBM-1047 zos-working-tree-encoding=utf-8
```

**Repository Structure**:
```
/banking-core
  /src
    /cobol
      /accounts
      /transactions
      /customer
    /copybook
    /jcl
    /pl1
  /test
    /unit
    /integration
    /verification
  /config
    /environments
    /deployment
  /.github
    /workflows
```

#### 2. AI Foundry Integration

Azure AI Foundry was configured to analyze the mainframe codebase:

```bash
az ai-foundry analysis create \
  --resource-group banking-modernization-rg \
  --aifoundry-name banking-ai-foundry \
  --source-repository https://github.com/bank/banking-core \
  --branch main \
  --language COBOL \
  --output-format JSON \
  --include-copybooks true \
  --include-jcl true \
  --output-file ./analysis-results.json
```

The analysis identified:
- 32 critical transaction flows
- 87 business rules in customer management
- 156 data dependencies
- 43 potential performance bottlenecks

This guided the modernization approach by highlighting the most critical components and their dependencies.

#### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

The GitHub Actions workflow was implemented as follows:

**mainframe-cicd.yml**:
```yaml
name: Mainframe CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'src/cobol/**'
      - 'src/jcl/**'

  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        type: choice
        options: [development, test, production]

        uses: mainframe-tools/setup-test@v1
        with:
          config-file: './config/test-environment.json'
      
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        uses: mainframe-tools/run-tests@v1
        with:
          test-suite: 'unit'
          test-environment: 'development'
  
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Environment
    needs: [build, test]
    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:

          deployment-config: './config/deployment-config.json'
          deployment-strategy: 'blue-green'
```

#### 4. Risk Assessment and Monitoring

Risk assessment was implemented using AI Foundry's risk assessment capabilities:

```bash
az ai-foundry risk-assessment create \
  --resource-group banking-modernization-rg \
  --aifoundry-name banking-ai-foundry \
  --deployment-id $(deploymentId) \
  --source-changes $(changes) \
  --risk-profile financial-core \
  --output-format detailed
```

Risk profiles were defined for different application components:

```json
{
  "riskProfiles": {
    "financial-core": {
      "securityWeight": 0.4,
      "performanceWeight": 0.2,
      "reliabilityWeight": 0.3,
      "businessImpactWeight": 0.1,
      "criticalComponents": [
        "ACCTPROC.cbl",
        "TRANSACT.cbl",
        "CUSTMGMT.cbl"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Hybrid Operations Implementation

The bank implemented a hybrid operations dashboard using Azure Monitor and AI Foundry:

```bash
az monitor dashboard create \
  --name BankingHybridOperations \
  --resource-group banking-modernization-rg \
  --location eastus \
  --template-file hybrid-ops-dashboard.json
```

Monitoring was configured to track key metrics across both mainframe and Azure:

```json
{
  "dashboardProperties": {
    "lenses": {
      "0": {
        "order": 0,
        "parts": {
          "0": {
            "position": {
              "x": 0,
              "y": 0,
              "colSpan": 6,
              "rowSpan": 4
            },
            "metadata": {
              "inputs": [
                {
                  "name": "resourceTypeMode",
                  "value": "workspace"
                },
                {
                  "name": "MainframeMetrics",
                  "value": {
                    "resourceMetadata": {
                      "id": "/subscriptions/$(subscription)/resourceGroups/$(resourceGroup)/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/$(workspace)"
                    },
                    "metrics": [
                      {
                        "name": "CPU_Utilization",
                        "aggregationType": "Average"
                      },
                      {
                        "name": "Transaction_Rate",
                        "aggregationType": "Sum"
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ],
              "type": "Extension/Microsoft_OperationsManagementSuite_Workspace/PartType/LogsDashboardPart",
              "settings": {
                "content": {
                  "Query": "MainframeMetrics_CL | summarize CPU=avg(CPU_Utilization_d), TPS=sum(Transaction_Rate_d) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

   - Starting with smaller, less critical applications built confidence.
   - Phased rollout of CI/CD capabilities was more successful than a big-bang approach.

3. **Hybrid Skills**:
   - Cross-training between mainframe and cloud teams was essential.
   - Creating a "Center of Excellence" with hybrid skills accelerated adoption.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Monitoring network latency between mainframe and Azure was critical.
   - Batch processing required optimization to handle cloud-to-mainframe data movement.

5. **Security Integration**:
