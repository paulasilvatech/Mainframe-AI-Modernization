# üì¶ CI/CD Implementation

This chapter provides detailed technical guidance for implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for IBM z/OS mainframe applications using Azure AI Foundry.

## üìã Overview

CI/CD implementation for mainframe applications requires specialized tools and approaches that can handle the unique characteristics of IBM z/OS environments. Azure AI Foundry provides intelligence capabilities that enhance the CI/CD process, enabling automated analysis, testing, and deployment of mainframe applications.

This implementation guide covers both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps pipelines, allowing teams to choose the platform that best aligns with their requirements.

## üéØ Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Standardized Pipelines | Implement standardized CI/CD pipelines for IBM z/OS applications |
| AI Integration | Integrate Azure AI Foundry intelligence into the build, test, and deployment process |
| Automated Testing | Establish automated testing and validation for mainframe applications |
| Deployment Strategy | Create consistent deployment strategies across environments |
| Risk Assessment | Enable AI-powered risk assessment for deployments |

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before implementing CI/CD pipelines, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Source Control | GitHub or Azure DevOps repository with properly configured .gitattributes |
| Azure AI Foundry | Configured Azure AI Foundry instance with mainframe integration |
| Mainframe Build Agent | Connectivity to IBM z/OS environment for compilation and testing |
| Authentication | Secure credential management for mainframe connectivity |
| Environment Configuration | Development, test, staging, and production environment definitions |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Source Control Configuration

Start by configuring proper source control for your mainframe code:

1. **Create Repository Structure**:
   ```
   /src
     /cobol      # COBOL source files
     /copybook   # Copybook includes
     /jcl        # JCL procedures
     /pl1        # PL/I source files
     /include    # Include files
   /test
     /unit       # Unit test scripts
     /integration # Integration tests
     /verification # Deployment verification tests
   /config       # Configuration files
   ```

2. **Configure .gitattributes**:
   Copy the template from `templates/gitattributes/mainframe-gitattributes` to your repository root as `.gitattributes`. This ensures proper handling of EBCDIC encoding and line endings for mainframe files.
   
   ```bash
   cp templates/gitattributes/mainframe-gitattributes .gitattributes
   ```

### 2. GitHub CI/CD Implementation

Follow these steps to implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Create Workflow Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Implement Reusable Workflow**:
   Copy the reusable workflow template:
   ```bash
   cp templates/workflows/mainframe-cicd-workflow.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

3. **Create Main CI/CD Pipeline**:
   Create a pipeline file that uses the reusable workflow:
   ```bash
   cp templates/workflows/sample-mainframe-cicd.yml .github/workflows/mainframe-ci-cd.yml
   ```

4. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   In your GitHub repository settings, add the following secrets:
   - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Azure service principal credentials JSON
   - `MAINFRAME_HOST`: IBM z/OS host address
   - `MAINFRAME_PORT`: Connection port
   - `MAINFRAME_USER`: Username for mainframe authentication
   - `MAINFRAME_PASSWORD`: Password for mainframe authentication

5. **Configure GitHub Environments**:
   Create environments in GitHub repository settings:
   - development
   - test
   - staging
   - production
   
   Apply appropriate protection rules and approval requirements for each environment.

### 3. Azure DevOps CI/CD Implementation

Follow these steps to implement Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Create Pipeline Template**:
   Place the template in your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p templates/pipelines
   cp templates/pipelines/mainframe-cicd-template.yml templates/pipelines/
   ```

2. **Create Main Pipeline Definition**:
   Create a pipeline file that uses the template:
   ```bash
   cp templates/pipelines/sample-mainframe-cicd.yml azure-pipelines.yml
   ```

3. **Configure Azure DevOps Service Connection**:
   - Create an Azure service connection named `azure-service-connection`
   - Configure variable groups for mainframe credentials:
     - `MAINFRAME_HOST`: IBM z/OS host address
     - `MAINFRAME_PORT`: Connection port
     - `MAINFRAME_USER`: Username for mainframe authentication
     - `MAINFRAME_PASSWORD`: Password for mainframe authentication

4. **Configure Azure DevOps Environments**:
   Create environments in Azure DevOps project settings:
   - development
   - test
   - staging
   - production
   
   Configure approval policies and checks for each environment.

### 4. Deployment Configuration

Configure the deployment templates to standardize the deployment process:

1. **Create Deployment Configuration**:
   Copy the deployment template:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config/deployment
   cp templates/deployment/mainframe-deployment-config.json config/deployment/
   ```

2. **Customize Environment Configuration**:
   Update the deployment configuration with your environment-specific settings for:
   - Mainframe connection details
   - Library names
   - Approval requirements
   - Notification settings

3. **Configure Deployment Strategy**:
   
   Choose the appropriate deployment strategy for each environment:
   
   | Strategy | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | Blue/Green | Creates parallel deployment and switches after validation |
   | Canary | Gradually increases deployment percentage |
   | Rolling | Updates in batches |

### 5. AI Foundry Integration

Configure Azure AI Foundry to enhance your CI/CD pipeline with intelligence:

1. **Code Analysis Integration**:
   - Configure code impact analysis for pull requests
   - Enable business rule extraction for documentation
   - Set up dependency mapping for change risk assessment

2. **Intelligent Testing**:
   - Implement AI-driven test selection to optimize test runs
   - Configure test result analysis for pattern detection
   - Set up performance anomaly detection

3. **Risk Assessment**:
