- 🧪 Establish automated testing and validation for mainframe applications
- 🚀 Create consistent deployment strategies across environments
- ⚠️ Enable AI-powered risk assessment for deployments

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before implementing CI/CD pipelines, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| 📂 Source Control | GitHub or Azure DevOps repository with properly configured .gitattributes |
| 🧠 Azure AI Foundry | Configured Azure AI Foundry instance with mainframe integration |

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1. 📂 Source Control Configuration

Start by configuring proper source control for your mainframe code:

1. **📁 Create Repository Structure**:
   ```
   /src
     /cobol      # COBOL source files
     /copybook   # Copybook includes
     /jcl        # JCL procedures
     /pl1        # PL/I source files
     /include    # Include files
   /test
     /unit       # Unit test scripts
     /integration # Integration tests
     /verification # Deployment verification tests
   /config       # Configuration files
   ```

2. **⚙️ Configure .gitattributes**:
   Copy the template from `templates/gitattributes/mainframe-gitattributes` to your repository root as `.gitattributes`. This ensures proper handling of EBCDIC encoding and line endings for mainframe files.
   
   ```bash
   cp templates/gitattributes/mainframe-gitattributes .gitattributes
   ```

### 2. 🐙 GitHub CI/CD Implementation

Follow these steps to implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines:

1. **📁 Create Workflow Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **📄 Implement Reusable Workflow**:
   Copy the reusable workflow template:
   ```bash
   cp templates/workflows/mainframe-cicd-workflow.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

3. **🔄 Create Main CI/CD Pipeline**:
   Create a pipeline file that uses the reusable workflow:
   ```bash
   cp templates/workflows/sample-mainframe-cicd.yml .github/workflows/mainframe-ci-cd.yml
   ```

4. **🔑 Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   In your GitHub repository settings, add the following secrets:
   - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Azure service principal credentials JSON
   - `MAINFRAME_HOST`: IBM z/OS host address
   - `MAINFRAME_PORT`: Connection port
   - `MAINFRAME_USER`: Username for mainframe authentication
   - `MAINFRAME_PASSWORD`: Password for mainframe authentication

5. **🌐 Configure GitHub Environments**:
   Create environments in GitHub repository settings:
   - development
   - test
   - staging
   - production
   
   Apply appropriate protection rules and approval requirements for each environment.

### 3. 🔄 Azure DevOps CI/CD Implementation

Follow these steps to implement Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines:

1. **📑 Create Pipeline Template**:
   Place the template in your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p templates/pipelines
   cp templates/pipelines/mainframe-cicd-template.yml templates/pipelines/
   ```

2. **📝 Create Main Pipeline Definition**:
   Create a pipeline file that uses the template:
   ```bash
   cp templates/pipelines/sample-mainframe-cicd.yml azure-pipelines.yml
   ```

3. **🔌 Configure Azure DevOps Service Connection**:
   - Create an Azure service connection named `azure-service-connection`
   - Configure variable groups for mainframe credentials:
     - `MAINFRAME_HOST`: IBM z/OS host address
     - `MAINFRAME_PORT`: Connection port
     - `MAINFRAME_USER`: Username for mainframe authentication
     - `MAINFRAME_PASSWORD`: Password for mainframe authentication

4. **🌐 Configure Azure DevOps Environments**:
   Create environments in Azure DevOps project settings:
   - development
   - test
   - staging
   - production
   
   Configure approval policies and checks for each environment.

### 4. 🚀 Deployment Configuration

Configure the deployment templates to standardize the deployment process:

1. **📝 Create Deployment Configuration**:
   Copy the deployment template:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config/deployment
   cp templates/deployment/mainframe-deployment-config.json config/deployment/
   ```

2. **⚙️ Customize Environment Configuration**:
   Update the deployment configuration with your environment-specific settings for:
   - Mainframe connection details
   - Library names
   - Approval requirements
   - Notification settings

3. **🔄 Configure Deployment Strategy**:
   Choose the appropriate deployment strategy for each environment:
   - 🔄 Blue/Green: Creates parallel deployment and switches after validation
   - 🚀 Canary: Gradually increases deployment percentage
   - 📦 Rolling: Updates in batches
