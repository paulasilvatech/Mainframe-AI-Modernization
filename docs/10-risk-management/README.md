## üíª Technical Implementation

### Risk Assessment Configuration

Implement AI-powered risk assessment by configuring Azure AI Foundry:

1. **Create Risk Profile Configuration**:

   ```json
   {
     "riskProfiles": {
       "default": {
         "securityWeight": 0.3,
         "performanceWeight": 0.2,
         "reliabilityWeight": 0.3,
         "businessImpactWeight": 0.2,
         "thresholds": {
           "low": 30,
           "medium": 60,
           "high": 80
         }
       },
       "financial": {
         "securityWeight": 0.4,
         "performanceWeight": 0.2,
         "reliabilityWeight": 0.3,
         "businessImpactWeight": 0.1,
         "thresholds": {
           "low": 20,
           "medium": 50,
           "high": 70
         }
       },
       "customer-facing": {
         "securityWeight": 0.3,
         "performanceWeight": 0.3,
         "reliabilityWeight": 0.2,
         "businessImpactWeight": 0.2,
         "thresholds": {
           "low": 30,
           "medium": 60,
           "high": 80
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Risk Assessment API**:

   ```bash
   az ai-foundry risk-assessment create \
     --name mainframe-risk-assessment \
     --resource-group mainframe-modernization-rg \
     --profile-path ./risk-profiles.json \
     --learning-enabled true \
     --history-days 90 \
     --model-version latest
   ```

3. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**:

   For GitHub Actions:
   ```yaml
   - name: AI-Powered Risk Assessment
     uses: azure/ai-foundry-risk-assessment@v1
     with:
       resource-group: $(AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)

       source-dir: ./src
       changes-only: true
       risk-profile: default
       output-file: 'risk-assessment.json'
   ```

   For Azure DevOps:
   ```yaml
   - task: AIFoundryRiskAssessment@1
     displayName: 'AI-Powered Risk Assessment'
     inputs:
       resourceGroup: $(azureResourceGroup)
       aiFoundryName: $(azureAIFoundryName)

       if [ $(echo "$RISK_SCORE > $RISK_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]; then
         echo "DEPLOY_DECISION=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
         echo "DEPLOY_MESSAGE=Deployment blocked due to high risk score ($RISK_SCORE)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
       else
         echo "DEPLOY_DECISION=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
         echo "DEPLOY_MESSAGE=Deployment approved with risk score: $RISK_SCORE" >> $GITHUB_ENV

       if [ $(echo "$RISK_SCORE < 30" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]; then
         echo "strategy=rolling" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       elif [ $(echo "$RISK_SCORE < 60" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]; then
         echo "strategy=blue-green" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       else
         echo "strategy=canary" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       fi
   ```

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           with:
             fetch-depth: 0
         
         - name: AI Risk Assessment

   ```

## ‚úÖ Validation Steps

After implementing the risk management framework, validate the implementation using these steps:

1. **üîç Validate Risk Assessment**:
   - Submit a test deployment with known risk patterns
   - Verify risk score calculation aligns with expectations
   - Confirm risk categorization is appropriate

2. **üß™ Test Deployment Strategy Selection**:
   - Create sample changes with varying risk levels
   - Verify appropriate deployment strategies are selected
   - Confirm approval workflows trigger correctly

3. **üì° Verify Monitoring Configuration**:
   - Deploy a controlled change
   - Inject simulated anomalies
   - Confirm detection and alerting functions

4. **‚è™ Test Automated Rollback**:
   - Deploy a change with embedded performance issue
   - Verify automatic detection and rollback
   - Confirm proper recording of incident

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| üìä Inaccurate risk scores | Verify risk profile configuration and adjust weights according to your environment |
| üö® False positive anomalies | Tune sensitivity settings and increase learning period for baseline establishment |
| üîó Missing dependency detection | Ensure full repository history is available and dependency mapping is enabled |
| ‚è±Ô∏è Delayed risk alerts | Check notification configuration and alert routing settings |
| üìâ Model drift over time | Schedule regular model retraining and validation against known outcomes |
