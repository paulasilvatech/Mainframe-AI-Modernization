# 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Implementations for Mainframe Modernization

This chapter provides detailed technical implementations of CI/CD pipelines for mainframe modernization across multiple platforms, using both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.

## 📋 Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for modernizing mainframe applications. They enable automated building, testing, and deployment of applications, reducing manual errors and accelerating the development process. This chapter provides comprehensive implementation examples for various mainframe platforms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔧 Implement platform-specific CI/CD pipelines for different mainframe environments
- 🐙 Create GitHub Actions workflows for mainframe modernization
- 🔄 Develop Azure DevOps pipelines for mainframe applications
- 🧪 Implement testing automation strategies for legacy code
- 🚀 Configure deployment strategies suitable for mainframe modernization

## 📚 Implementation Guides

This chapter includes the following implementation guides:

1. [🐙 GitHub Actions Workflows](github-actions-workflows.md) - Complete workflow examples for IBM z/OS, Unisys ClearPath, Bull GCOS, and NEC ACOS
2. [🔄 Azure DevOps Pipelines](azure-devops-pipelines.md) - Pipeline configurations for different mainframe platforms
3. [🧪 Testing Automation](testing-automation.md) - Strategies for automating tests for mainframe applications
4. [🚀 Deployment Strategies](deployment-strategies.md) - Implementation of blue-green, canary, and other deployment patterns

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. 🔍 Code Analysis Pipelines

Pipelines that automatically analyze mainframe code to:
- Identify potential issues and risks
- Generate documentation
- Extract business rules
- Prepare for transformation

### 2. 🔄 Transformation Pipelines

Pipelines that convert legacy code to modern languages:
- COBOL to Java/C#/.NET transformations
- PL/I to modern language conversions
- Assembler to higher-level language migrations
- Database schema conversions

### 3. 🧪 Testing Pipelines

Comprehensive testing strategies for:
- Functional equivalence validation
- Performance testing
- Regression testing
- Integration testing between legacy and modern components

### 4. 🚀 Deployment Pipelines

Modern deployment approaches adapted for mainframe applications:
- Blue-green deployment strategies
- Canary releases for risk reduction
- Progressive exposure deployments
- Rollback automation

## 🔧 Integration Points

These pipeline implementations integrate with:
- Version control systems (GitHub, Azure Repos)
- Artifact repositories
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment targets (cloud and on-premises)
- Monitoring systems

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start by exploring the [GitHub Actions Workflows](github-actions-workflows.md) implementation guide, which provides complete workflow examples for different mainframe platforms. Then proceed to the [Azure DevOps Pipelines](azure-devops-pipelines.md) guide for alternative implementations.
