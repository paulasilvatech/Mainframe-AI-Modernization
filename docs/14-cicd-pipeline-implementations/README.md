# üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Implementations for Mainframe Modernization

This chapter provides detailed technical implementations of CI/CD pipelines for mainframe modernization across multiple platforms, using both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.

## üìã Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for modernizing mainframe applications. They enable automated building, testing, and deployment of applications, reducing manual errors and accelerating the development process. This chapter provides comprehensive implementation examples for various mainframe platforms.

## üéØ Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Platform-Specific Pipelines | Implement platform-specific CI/CD pipelines for different mainframe environments |
| GitHub Actions | Create GitHub Actions workflows for mainframe modernization |
| Azure DevOps | Develop Azure DevOps pipelines for mainframe applications |
| Testing Automation | Implement testing automation strategies for legacy code |
| Deployment Strategies | Configure deployment strategies suitable for mainframe modernization |

## üìö Implementation Guides

This chapter includes the following implementation guides:

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [GitHub Actions Workflows](github-actions-workflows.md) | Complete workflow examples for IBM z/OS, Unisys ClearPath, Bull GCOS, and NEC ACOS |
| [Azure DevOps Pipelines](azure-devops-pipelines.md) | Pipeline configurations for different mainframe platforms |
| [Testing Automation](testing-automation.md) | Strategies for automating tests for mainframe applications |
| [Deployment Strategies](deployment-strategies.md) | Implementation of blue-green, canary, and other deployment patterns |

## üß© Key Components

### 1. Code Analysis Pipelines

Pipelines that automatically analyze mainframe code to:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Issue Identification | Identify potential issues and risks |
| Documentation | Generate documentation |
| Business Rules | Extract business rules |
| Transformation Preparation | Prepare for transformation |

### 2. Transformation Pipelines

Pipelines that convert legacy code to modern languages:

| Transformation Type | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| COBOL Transformation | COBOL to Java/C#/.NET transformations |
| PL/I Conversion | PL/I to modern language conversions |
| Assembler Migration | Assembler to higher-level language migrations |
| Database Conversion | Database schema conversions |

### 3. Testing Pipelines

Comprehensive testing strategies for:

| Testing Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Functional Equivalence | Validation of functional equivalence |
| Performance Testing | Measuring performance characteristics |
| Regression Testing | Ensuring no functionality is lost |
| Integration Testing | Testing between legacy and modern components |

### 4. Deployment Pipelines

Modern deployment approaches adapted for mainframe applications:

| Deployment Strategy | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Blue-Green Deployment | Running two production environments in parallel |
| Canary Releases | Gradual rollout to reduce risk |
| Progressive Exposure | Targeted exposure to specific user groups |
| Rollback Automation | Automated procedures for recovering from issues |

## üîß Integration Points

These pipeline implementations integrate with:

| Integration Point | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Version Control | GitHub, Azure Repos |
| Artifact Repositories | Storage for build outputs |
| Testing Frameworks | Automated testing tools |
| Deployment Targets | Cloud and on-premises environments |
| Monitoring Systems | Production monitoring and alerting |
