# üîç Discovery and Assessment Phase

This chapter covers the discovery and assessment phase for multiple mainframe platforms (IBM z/OS, Unisys ClearPath, Bull GCOS, and NEC ACOS) using Azure AI Foundry.

## üìã Overview

The discovery and assessment phase is the crucial first step in your mainframe modernization journey. Using Azure AI Foundry's intelligence capabilities, this phase establishes a comprehensive understanding of your existing mainframe environments, identifies dependencies, and creates an actionable modernization strategy that addresses the unique characteristics of each platform.

## üéØ Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Inventory | Create a detailed inventory of all mainframe applications and components across platforms |
| Dependency Mapping | Map dependencies between applications, programs, and data assets in each environment |
| Assessment | Assess application complexity and identify modernization candidates for each platform |
| Knowledge Extraction | Extract business rules and application knowledge from diverse mainframe platforms |
| Strategy Development | Develop a comprehensive modernization strategy that accommodates platform differences |
