# 🔍 Discovery and Assessment Phase

This chapter covers the discovery and assessment phase for IBM z/OS mainframe modernization using Azure AI Foundry.

## 📋 Overview

The discovery and assessment phase is the crucial first step in your mainframe modernization journey. Using Azure AI Foundry's intelligence capabilities, this phase establishes a comprehensive understanding of your existing IBM z/OS environment, identifies dependencies, and creates an actionable modernization strategy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 Create a detailed inventory of all mainframe applications and components
- 🔗 Map dependencies between applications, programs, and data assets
- 📈 Assess application complexity and identify modernization candidates
- 📝 Extract business rules and application knowledge
- 🗺️ Develop a comprehensive modernization strategy

## 📝 Technical Steps

1. [📋 Mainframe Inventory Process](01-inventory.md) - Systematic inventory of your z/OS environment
2. [🔗 Dependency Mapping with AI Foundry](02-dependency-mapping.md) - AI-assisted mapping of application dependencies
3. [🧠 AI-Powered Assessment Criteria](03-assessment-criteria.md) - Using AI to assess modernization complexity and priority

## ✅ Technical Prerequisites

Before beginning this phase, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| 💾 z/OS Access | Access to the IBM z/OS environment with appropriate permissions |
| 📚 System Catalogs | Access to system catalogs for program and dataset information |
| 📊 SMF Records | Access to System Management Facility (SMF) records for usage analysis |
| 💻 Source Code Access | Access to COBOL, PL/I, JCL, and Assembler code repositories |
| 🗃️ Database Schemas | Access to DB2, IMS, and VSAM file structures |
| 📝 Transaction Logs | Access to CICS and IMS transaction logs (if applicable) |

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

1. **🚀 Deploy Discovery Tools**
   - Install Azure AI Foundry discovery agents on z/OS
   - Configure secure connectivity between z/OS and Azure
   - Validate access permissions and connectivity

2. **📋 Execute Application Inventory**
   - Scan system catalogs for program information
   - Analyze JCL procedures for job relationships
   - Extract COBOL, PL/I, and Assembler program information
   - Document database schemas and file structures

3. **📊 Analyze Application Usage**
   - Process SMF records to identify usage patterns
   - Map transaction volumes and frequencies
   - Identify peak processing periods
   - Document batch window requirements

4. **🔗 Map Dependencies**
   - Use AI-powered analysis to identify program calls
   - Map data access patterns and dependencies
   - Document external interfaces and integration points
   - Create application dependency graphs

5. **📈 Assess Modernization Potential**
   - Apply AI analysis to determine modernization complexity
   - Categorize applications by modernization approach
   - Identify technical debt and risks
   - Prioritize applications for modernization

## 📦 Key Deliverables

- **📋 Mainframe Application Inventory** - Comprehensive catalog of all applications and components
- **🔗 Dependency Map** - Visual and data representation of application interdependencies
- **📊 Complexity Assessment** - Analysis of application complexity and modernization effort
