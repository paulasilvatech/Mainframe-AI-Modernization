## Key Differences in Inventory Collection

The multi-vendor inventory process must account for significant differences between platforms:

| Area | IBM z/OS | Unisys ClearPath | Bull GCOS | NEC ACOS |
|------|----------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Catalog Structure** | Hierarchical catalog with ICF structure | Flat catalog with object-based structure | Network directory service | Hierarchical system catalog |
| **System API Access** | z/OSMF REST APIs, REXX interfaces | MCP API, ClearPath ePortal | Bull IOF API, GCOS CLI | ACOS Management API, NDMII |
| **Security Mechanisms** | RACF, ACF2, or Top Secret | ClearPath Security, capability-based access | GCOS Security, ring protection | ESS, tiered access control |
| **Code Storage** | PDS, PDSE, source management systems | Program files, libraries | Source libraries, modules | Program libraries, segments |
| **Transaction Definitions** | CICS CSD, IMS SYSGEN | COMS UTIL, TIP configuration | TP8 definitions | AIM/DC configurations |
| **Job Structure** | JCL with PROC libraries | WFL procedures, ECL scripts | JCL with specific syntax | NCL job structures |
| **Database Catalog** | DB2 catalog, IMS DBDLIB/PSBLIB | DMSII DASDL, DMS schemas | IDS/II schema, DBSP catalog | AIM DB catalog, RDB system tables |

## Cross-Platform Inventory Strategy

Azure AI Foundry provides specialized agents for each mainframe platform while maintaining a consistent inventory structure:

1. **Platform-Specific Extraction**:
   - Custom extraction modules for each platform's unique catalogs
   - Platform-appropriate authentication and security handling
   - Specialized parsing for platform-specific languages and constructs
   - Targeted analysis of platform dependencies

2. **Unified Inventory Repository**:
   - Common metadata structure across all platforms
   - Normalized component relationships
   - Standardized technical artifacts
   - Cross-platform dependency mapping

3. **AI-Assisted Correlation**:
   - Intelligent identification of similar components across platforms
   - Automatic recognition of equivalent business functions
   - Pattern matching for similar data structures
   - Functional similarity detection regardless of implementation

## Next Steps

After completing the multi-vendor inventory:
- Review [Platform Migration Patterns](../03-foundation/patterns/migration-patterns.md) for each mainframe type
- Understand [Cross-Platform Integration](../11-hybrid-operations/cross-platform-integration.md) approaches
- Implement the appropriate [Multi-Vendor Testing Strategy](../09-cicd-implementation/multi-vendor-testing.md)
